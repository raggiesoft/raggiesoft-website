    </h1>
    <div class="fs-5"> <p class="lead mb-4">The Telsan Axiom is not a true government; it's a vast, interplanetary logistics corporation that holds a legal, monopolistic charter over the entire Telsan Gap. They are the de facto law. Their oppression isn't ideological, it's economic. They don't have stormtroopers; they have Compliance Agents and Auditors.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md">
            <p class="fs-5 mb-3"> <p>The Axiom maintains control over Telsus Minor through several key strategies:</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">The Axiom controls all trade routes through the Telsan Gap, imposing heavy tariffs and fees on all goods.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">They maintain a network of informants and spies to root out dissent and maintain control.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The Axiom's enforcers are known for their brutal tactics, often using violence to quash any resistance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md">
            <p class="fs-5 mb-3"> The Axiom's presence is felt everywhere on Telsus Minor, from the towering spires of Port Telsus to the remote outposts in the jungle. Their influence extends into every aspect of life on the planet, and their grip on power seems unbreakable.</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Compliance Agents (Ticks):</strong> This is the most visible, public-facing, and loathed arm of the Axiom. They aren't soldiers; they're a privatized, brutalist police force. Their primary tool is a heavy, electrified Compliance Baton.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Axiom Auditors (Razors):</strong> An Auditor is the one who enforces the economic oppression. They don't patrol; they arrive to investigate fuel-skimming, doctored manifests, and delinquent tariffs. A Compliance Agent beats you; an Auditor bankrupts you.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Axiom Sentinels (Spire-Shadows):</strong> These are the professional soldiers. They guard the Spire, act as bodyguards, and are the ones sent on missions into the Green Hell. They are the ones actually hunting for the phantom Knox.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Fiduciary Integrity Division (Whispers):</strong> This is the Axiom's internal affairs, counter-intelligence, and loyalty enforcement. They are invisible and do not wear uniforms. Their power comes from anonymity, and they instill paranoia. If a Whisper catches you, you simply vanish.</li>
